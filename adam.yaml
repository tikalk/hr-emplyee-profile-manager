- title: Python & JS Developer @ Healarium
  years: '2013'
  description:
    "- Worked with all aspects of the code base, both server-side (Django and Python) and client-side (JavaScript and CSS3/HTML5).
    - Main developer in a complete redesign from scratch of the of the web interface, using modern coding practices, CSS3, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
      The project introduced modern web design tools and frameworks (SASS/Compass and Foundation).
    - Responsible for a significant clean-up of legacy JavaScript code, enabling use of modern techniques for loading JavaScript and dealing with dependencies.
    - Responsible for creating a completely new administration page in the client's web application to handle a large feature addition,
      involving both server-side development of an API and a complete implementation of the client side of the page.
      The result was a new general framework for creating administration pages in the client's web application using Backbone.js for the client-side framework,
      which is expected to dramatically decrease the amount of time necessary for creating similar pages in the future, and to increase the consistency and maintainability of this and similar pages.
    - Instrumental in delivering a new major version of the client's software to a major client, which fulfilled the contractual obligation regarding features, and was delivered on time and with good quality (low bug count)."
